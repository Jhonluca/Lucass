<h2>My name is Jhon Lloyd S. Lucas and I’m 19 years old. I was born on August 14,2004
In Zamboanga City I’m grade 12 student that took academic track in the
strand of STEM at tampilisan Senior High School (ACSHS). My parents are Marletand Emmanuel De Guzman. My mother is working abroad as an OFW to provide financial support for us while my father is the one that takes good care and guides meand my siblings. I have two brothers, the oldest one named girlie S. Lucas, he finished his study in the course BTTE major in English at MarikinaPolytechnic College (MPC). My youngest brother named mark Lucas isnow in 6th
 
Grade at Bacungan  Elementary School (BES).
There is a lot of things that I like and a few things that I don’t like. I like
having funwith friends and going somewhere with them. Sometimes I also prefer to stay at homeand watched some movies with my family while eating a lunch of salty foods. I alsolove watching vlogs,  tutorial and lifestyle videos on YouTube and apply thoseknowledge
to myself. The thing that I don’t like the most is when
someone brothers me
and I’m doing an important paper works for school that’s the thing that really gets me
and. I can say that our family is in good condition
and I’m lucky to have a complete
family. We have experienced many difficulties in life but we never let them to break ourfamily. first attend school at the age of 2 and my mother enrolled me as a nursery at theDay Care Center near at our house. When I was a kid, I was forcing my parents toenroll me in a school because when I say my brother everyday before and after goingto school I imagine that school is just like a playground that makes everybody happywhere you can also gain more knowledge and friends. But as the time goes by I haveexperienced and encountered a lot of things in school, until now. I started makingmemories with my classmates, teachers and friends or should I say my second familyand they never failed me to have the best memories and unforgettable moments withthem every year. I just found myself in school that is why I love going to schooleveryday even sometimes it makes me so tired. I do have a lot of dreams in life and start working of it because I really want to make my dreams comes true.
